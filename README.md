League-Stats
============

The name's tentative, I'm just pretty much using this project to learn how to use Riot's API and parse JSON. 

Usage
====
In order to use this, you need to get your own API key from http://developer.riotgames.com and make a header file called "key.h" 
with a global constant called API_KEY which stores just your key.
